# 🧠 Ask the Web Assistant

Ask the Web Assistant is a Streamlit-based app that takes a user question, retrieves relevant web content, and returns a verified answer using an LLM-powered pipeline.

---

## 🔧 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ask-the-web-assistant.git
cd ask-the-web-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
````

> Make sure your environment includes access to the required API keys as shown in .env.example.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User enters a question**
2. **get\_links**: fetches relevant URLs
3. **scrape\_web\_data**: downloads and parses content from links
4. **generate\_answer**: LLM generates an answer based on scraped data
5. **verify\_citations**: ensures information is traceable
6. **Answer and debug info are displayed**
7. **Telemetry is recorded (optional)**

## 🗺️ Architecture

## 💬 Prompt(s) Used

* **Prompt**: `"You are a helpful assistant. Based on the following content, answer the user's question truthfully and cite the source."`
* **Rationale**: Ensures the LLM grounds answers in retrieved data with verifiable citations.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* Citation verification is heuristic-based and not foolproof.
* Web scraping may fail on pages with anti-bot mechanisms.
* LLMs may still hallucinate if input context is low-quality or off-topic.
